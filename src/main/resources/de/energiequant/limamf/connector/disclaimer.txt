This is an unofficial project, both in terms of MobiFlight and hardware
manufacturers. Unless endorsed by a manufacturer, please direct
questions/bug reports only to the author(s) of this application, not to
panel manufacturers or MobiFlight. Correct operation of hardware panels
should always be verified according to official instructions (i.e.
using original MobiFlight software on a supported platform).

As this application interfaces with actual hardware, there is a risk of
damage being caused, for example but not limited to e.g. the unit,
health or property. THAT RISK IS AMPLIFIED by interfacing with a
firmware not controlled by the author(s) of this application. By using
this application, users accept that none of the author(s), nor any of
the author(s) of MobiFlight, nor panel manufacturers shall be held
liable for any damage or harm being potentially caused associated with
the usage of this application. Carefully read the license for details,
as well as the license/disclaimer texts associated with MobiFlight's
firmware (see MobiFlight for details).

Use of this application may void your warranty.
