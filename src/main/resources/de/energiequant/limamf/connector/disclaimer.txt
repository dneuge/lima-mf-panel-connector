This is an unofficial project, both in terms of MobiFlight and hardware
manufacturers. Unless endorsed by a manufacturer, please direct
questions/bug reports only to the author(s) of this application, not to
panel manufacturers or MobiFlight. Correct operation of hardware panels
should always be verified according to official instructions (i.e.
using original MobiFlight software on a supported platform).

As this application interfaces with actual hardware, there is a RISK OF
DAMAGE BEING CAUSED, for example but not limited to e.g. hardware,
health or property. THAT RISK IS AMPLIFIED by interfacing with a
firmware not controlled by the author(s) of this application. By using
this application, users accept that none of the authors of this
application or its dependencies/libraries, nor any of the authors of
MobiFlight, nor panel manufacturers shall be held liable for any damage
or harm being potentially caused by or being associated with the use of
this application. Carefully read all licenses and their disclaimers for
details, as well as the license/disclaimer texts associated with
MobiFlight's firmware (see MobiFlight for details).

Using this application may void the warranty of your hardware modules.
